### Delete Volume from Filesystem Directory

To delete a volume from a filesystem directory using `libvirtd` and `virt-manager`, you can use the `virsh` command-line tool, which is a part of the libvirt suite. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify the Volume:**
   - First, list the storage pools to identify the pool that contains the volume:
     ```sh
     virsh pool-list
     ```

2. **List Volumes in the Pool:**
   - Once you have identified the storage pool, list the volumes in that pool to find the volume you want to delete:
     ```sh
     virsh vol-list poolname
     ```
     Replace `poolname` with the name of your storage pool.

3. **Delete the Volume:**
   - Use the `virsh vol-delete` command to delete the specified volume:
     ```sh
     virsh vol-delete --pool poolname volumename
     ```
     Replace `poolname` with the name of your storage pool and `volumename` with the name of the volume you want to delete.

### Example:

Assume you have a storage pool named `default` and a volume named `test.qcow2`.

1. List storage pools:
   ```sh
   virsh pool-list
   ```

2. List volumes in the `default` pool:
   ```sh
   virsh vol-list default
   ```

3. Delete the volume `test.qcow2` from the `default` pool:
   ```sh
   virsh vol-delete --pool default test.qcow2
   ```

This sequence of commands will delete the specified volume from the filesystem directory managed by `libvirtd`. Always ensure that the volume is not in use before deleting it to avoid data loss or corruption.
